Machines learning training exercises
========================

## Machine learning algorithms 

## Introduction

This repo contains exercises covering the main practical implementation of machine learning

### Supervised learning:

#### non-classification algorithms
  * linear regression
  * linear regression with polynomial features

#### classification algorithms
  * logistic regression
  * neural networks
  * support vector machine (with gaussian kernel)

### Unsupervised learning: clusterisation
  * K-means clustering algorithm (K = choice of clusters)
  * anomaly detection algorithm: Gaussian and multiVariateGaussian (with threshold epsilon)

### Dimensionality reduction algorithms: (accelerate future processing)
  * Principal component analysis

### Reccomandation algorithm:
  * Collaborative filtering 

### Learning curves: Bias vs Variance 

## Languages/Platforms/Tools

* Matlab or GNU octave

## Learning Outcomes

This was my first challenge in Matlab / GNU Octave.
The goal was to hae an understanding of pratical applications of some machine learning algorithm. I think I went beyond basic understanding as I did all the necessary mathematical demonstration (available on stats.stackexchange.com).

## Instructions

Install Ocatve or Matlab if you don't have it already (using brew on OSX or directly from the websites: http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)
