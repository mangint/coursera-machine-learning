Machines learning training exercises:

Supervised learning:

- non-classification algorithms
  # linear regression
  # linear regression with polynomial features

- classification algorithms
  # logistic regression
  # neural networks
  # support vector machine (with gaussian kernel)

Unsupervised learning: clusterisation
  # K-means clustering algorithm (K = choice of clusters)
  # anomaly detection algorithm: Gaussian and multiVariateGaussian (with threshold epsilon)

Dimensionality reduction algorithms: (accelerate future processing)
  # Principal component analysis

Reccomandation algorithm:
  # Collaborative filtering 

Learning curves: Bias vs Variance
